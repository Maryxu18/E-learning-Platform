# Product Backlog

1. As an admin, I would like have control over access permissions so that users can only see information relevant to them.

   - Admin can grant permission for a user to become a mentor
   - Admin can delete/add user
   - Admin can edit any information on the platform

2. As a participant, I would like to be able to view my deliverable deadlines and scheduled workshops in a calendar so that I can better organize my time.

   - Should be able to see past & future deadlines
   - Calendar should be private and only seen by the participant
   - Deadlines should be added to the calendar in an automated way (eg. pulled from deliverable deadlines or workshop schedules)

3. As a founder of a company, I would like to be able to post job postings so that I can recruit more members to join my company.

   - Job posting should have job description and button to apply/privately message the founder
   - Job postings should be visible to all participants

4. As an admin, I would like to be able to approve new users so that I can control access to the platform.

   - Admin should see a list of users that signed up with a button to approve the user
   - Users without admin approval should not have access to the platform

5. As a participant, I would like to see a personalized dashboard upon login so that I can see information that is relevant to me immediately.
   - participant dashboards should have recommended actions
   - recommended actions are assigned deliverables and pre-recorded content in the category that the participant
   - expressed interest in or based on previously watched.
