            AG-40: Sprint 1 Retrospective

Spikes during the first the sprint:
    Spike 1:
        Problem:
            Setting up the software to develop and test the backend took a significant amount of time.
            Members working on backend tasks claimed to have difficulty with setup and installation.

        Affected tasks:
            AG-25: Login back end
            AG-21: Sign Up back end
            AG-34: Create partner profile back end 
            AG-30: Create mentor profile back end
            AG-27: Create participant profile back end

    Spike 2:
        Problem:
            Learning to create a user interface with react native took longer than expected.
            Members spent a few days learning how to utilize and test the frontend code.

        Affected tasks:
            AG-24: Login front-end
            AG-22: Sign Up front-end
            AG-28: Create participant profile front end
            AG-31: Create mentor profle front end
            AG-33: Create partner profile front end

    Spike 3: 
        Problem:
            Integrating the frontend and the backend was harder than we thought.
            It look a lot of back and forth discussions to deliver a working solution.
        
        Affected tasks:
            AG-24: Login front-end
            AG-22: Sign Up front-end
            AG-28: Create participant profile front end
            AG-31: Create mentor profle front end
            AG-33: Create partner profile front end

Team Capacity: 
    For 40 points worth of tasks and 6 members, our team would dedicate at least 1 hour per day over the course of the entire sprint to work towards our tasks.
