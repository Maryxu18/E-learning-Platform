### Participants:

- Kenneth Daniel
- Jenny Ho
- Alexander Efimov

### Unfinished tasks

- Another cleanup pass on UI/back end code would have been nice
- Testing for front-end code

### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?

- Frequently communicating blockers/questions in the discord server
- Daily standup to get status update
- Delegating work according to experience

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?

- Potential for frontend devs to work on figma together for better cohesion
- Come up with a list of topics to talk about in meeting in advance
- Finishing the design before starting the implementation
- Spending some time on setting standards for front-end design

### What are some harmful practices that you might want to stop using during next sprint?

- Splitting work horizontally instead of vertically
  - We had several people working on nearly-identical features, resulting in wasted time and inconsistent design
- Starting late: debugging environment setup issues 3 days before the deadline was not fun
- Too many branches: we don't need branches for admin tasks and most subtasks

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1?

- Best: Learning new frameworks
- Worst: Merge conflicts
