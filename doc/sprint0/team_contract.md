# Team Expectations Agreement


*When working in a team, problems occasionally arise. One source of problems is the differing expectations of team members. For example, one person may think that an email response should come within 2 hours, while another may think that 2 days is acceptable.
In this tutorial, your team will work on establishing team expectations. In the space below, write down the list of agreed upon guidelines that your team intends to follow. Include guidelines for the following:*

- methods of communication
   - Primary: Discord
   - Phone call if they’re unresponsive on Discord
- communication response times
   - Around 3-5 hours
   - Except from 12-8am Toronto time
- meeting attendance (when to meet, whether all meetings are mandatory, . . . )
   - All meetings are mandatory, unless specified otherwise
- running meetings (when, where, face-to-face vs. online, who takes minutes, . . . )
   - On Discord
   - Meetings will be held twice a week
   - Write down an agenda for each meeting
   - Post an agenda 12 hours in advance
   - Weekly meetings to plan/divide work
   - Anyone on a rotational basis.
      - Post minutes on Discord (#meeting-minutes) after the meeting
   - Schedule meetings at least 1 day in advance, and ping everyone
      - Add meetings to the calendar
- Daily Sprint meetings
   - Also on Discord (in the CSCC01 server)
   - Monday to Friday at 9PM (every day)
   - No meetings on the weekend
   - If you can’t make it, notify us on Discord, and provide your update as a message
- meeting preparation (whether preparation is needed, what to prepare, . . . )
   - For deliverables, be ready with progress updates/blockers
   - Questions about the agenda
- version control (what to/not to commit, content of log messages, . . . )
   - All team members agree to use Git version control
   - Write a message in the chat when you push changes
      - Maybe use a discord bot to automate
   - Use git flow
- division of work (how to divide work, who will decide who does what, . . . )
   - Decided each week in the weekly meeting
- submitting assignments (when to submit, who will submit, who will review the submission, . . . )
   - Have meeting to review work 2-3 days before the work is due
   - Review work each biweekly meeting
- contingency planning (what if a team member drops out, what if a team member consistently misses meetings, what if a team member is academically dishonest, . . . ) We suggest that in these cases, a team promptly seeks help from the instructor. It is important not to let such situations escalate.
   - If someone drops out, schedule a meeting immediately to redistribute work
   - If a team member consistently misses meetings without any legitimate reason, he/she would be reported to the course instructor(even if you have a legitimate reason tell the group in advance).
   - If a team member is academically dishonest, inform the instructor right away
The list above is just meant to get you started. If you had any team problems in the past, think about what went wrong and how expectations can be set to prevent those types of problems. We accept these guidelines and intend to fulfill them (sign below):
