# Competition

### Competitor 1 - StartupNation

#### StartupNation URL: https://community.startupnation.com/

StartupNation is an online community platform that encourages innovators/entrepreneurs to interact with each other on topics relating to entrepreneurship, start-ups, small businesses and innovations. StartupNation is a free service and there's no charge to join or open an account - interested entrepreneurs can just create an account for free. It provides users with everything they need to know about growing their business. It has a wealth of forums, groups to join, articles to learn from and networking opportunities for members(e-learning).

The African Impact Challenge community/e-learning (our product) has similar features with StartupNation like profile creations, e-learning, user-interactions, and community interactions. However, our product has differences that distinguishes itself from StartupNation. For one, our product allows for partner profile creations (investors, service providers & corporations), not just entrepreneur profile creations. What this does for our entrepreneur-users is that it provides them the opportunity to connect with potential partners - which StartupNation doesn't have. So, in essence, entrepreneur-users and partner-users benefit from our platform, because we serve as an intermediary to connect new businesses with potential partners.

Also, another difference is that our product is specifically geared towards African entrepreneurs, while StartupNation is geared towards entrepreneurs worldwide. So, our product is better for African entrepreneur-users as it gives them the opportunity to connect with individuals closer to their geographical location, who can relate more to factors associated with starting a business in Africa. Streamlining our entrepreneur-users to be solely African start-ups also helps the users feel a lot closer to each other, compared to if it was a global community like StartupNation. Hence, our focused user base creates a stronger community bond for our users and also provides solutions best suited for them, in particular. 

StartupNation didn't focus on African entrepreneurs because they're focused on catering to entrepreneurs all over the world. The belief being that they'd be able to make more impact and reach more people globally, than just Africa alone. To specifically cater to African users StartupNation would have to create a whole new website or entirely change their business strategy and completely modify their website. StartupNation also didn't focus on partner-users because their goal was solely to build a community of entrepreneurs and not to help companies/entrepreneurs gain partners. To focus on partner-users StartupNation would have to modify their website with features specific to partner users and create connections in the website that link partners to other users, for possible collaborations and networking.

### Competitor 2 - StartupGrind

#### StartupGrind URL: https://www.startupgrind.com/

StartupGrind is also a global community for Startup owners. It provides entrepreneurs and company start-ups an opportunity to learn(e-learning), connect and share their wins and losses with other entrepreneurs through StartupGrind’s online platform. 

StartupGrind has similar features with the African Impact Challenge community/e-learning in that they both allow company and individual profile creations. They both have e-learning for their users, and both offer mentorship to their users.

However, our product has features that makes it different from StartupGrind. For one, our product has partner profile creation which StartupGrind doesn’t have. This allows partner-users to connect with individuals and companies who they may potentially want to do business with. So, in a sense our product serves as an intermediary to connect companies with potential partners. As a result, this feature is beneficial to all users of our platform. Also, just like StartupNation, StartupGrind didn’t focus on partner-users because their goal was specifically to create and cater to a community of entrepreneurs. If StartupGrind wants to focus on partner-users, they’d simply have to modify their existing website and create a sign, login and other features for partner-users.

Lastly, compared to StartupGrind, The African Impact Challenge community/e-learning (our product) is better for African entrepreneurs and start-up companies. Why? Because the whole mission/goal of our product is to invest in Africa’s aspiring entrepreneurs. This sets us apart from StartupGrind, as our product is better for African users (African entrepreneurs and companies included);It is built to specifically cater to these users and provide resources and opportunities that are most suitable to them. Like StartupNation, StartupGrind didn’t focus on these users because their goal is to cater to entrepreneurs world-wide, not just in one continent. For StartupGrind to specifically cater for African users they may have to create a new website for this niche or change their entire business strategy to be focused on just African entrepreneurs.
