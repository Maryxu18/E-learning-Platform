# Process

#### How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
Roles: 
- Product owner: Efosa, the founder of African Impact Initiative
- Developers: The entire team (Alex, Jenny, Hongkang, Kenneth, Mary, Richard).
- Testers: The entire team (Alex, Jenny, Hongkang, Kenneth, Mary, Richard).
- Scrum Master: This duty will be assumed by the T.A's.

We have longer meetings once or twice a week which is longer than the daily ones. We communicate our project process in the standup meetings.
We have standup meetings to argue about our project, distribute the tasks, and figure out the doubts we have as a team.
To distribute the tasks, we split the work into 6 portions, and everyone voluntarily takes the part that he/she wants to do and good at.
We use discord for meetings and communication, and google doc and git for committing our works.

#### How did you make decisions?
We make decisions as a team. We either make decisions together in the meetings, or vote on discord.
If we have something vague in the process of decision making, we would make it clear then make the decision.

#### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? 
We first ask the product owner for which points should be prioritized before each sprints. We vote on which points should be prioritized, and if we have disagreements on that, we argue about the value, cost and risks on those points and prioritize the points with the highest ROI.

#### How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
On average it takes us 3 rounds to come to a consensus for the point estimate.

#### How frequently did you meet?
Longer meetings are once or twice a week.
We have daily standup meetings during the weekdays to communicate what we have done and what we are going to work on from our tasks.

##### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
Our process of making decisions as a team respects everyone's attitude. The daily meetings guarantee that everyone follows
the process of the project, and our doubts can be solved quickly. Those are the things we should take forward to the next phase.
