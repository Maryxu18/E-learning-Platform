# Summary

## Objective
This project aims to create a platform for African Impact Challenge participants to learn online, as well as interact with each other and with sponsors. The learning platform should provide access to video and written resources, as well as the ability to submit deliverables and receive feedback from mentors. The community portion should allow participants to create profiles and teams, and for those to be visible across the platform.

## Key Personas
- Adelae Mueni, a 4th-year student studying environmental conservation and natural resource management. She is a participant in the African Impact Challenge, with a goal to create a digital solution to manage daily plastic waste.

- Daniel Zawadi, a 30-year old software engineer currently working at Microsoft. He builds IoT services, and is a specialist in Android development. He is a technical mentor for the African Impact Challenge. 

- Johnathan Lutz, a Senior Analyst at Open Capital, a consulting firm that works with financial companies to advance sustainable development in Africa. He is a business mentor for the African Impact Challenge. 

## Key Scenarios
- Adelae's team would like to use Java for the back end of their application, but some of them have never used Java before. They need resources to introduce them to the important concepts of Java applications, and contact with mentors to help them with issues.

- Jonathan has just finished helping a team with their product. Later, they finish a big component of their submission based on Jonathan's help. The team would like to submit it to a technical mentor to receive feedback on the technical part of it. Having them registered as a team should allow the mentor to see their profiles and what each of their strengths are, and the feedback from Jonathan.

- Daniel has just finished designing the deliverables for the next iteration of the challenge. He needs to submit the deliverables so that they are visible to students. His profile should be visible to students, and there should be a way for students to contact him to resolve any questions they might have.


## Key Principles
- Stability over performance: the application working without errors is more important to users than the application being fast. Unstable, buggy software is frustrating to users, more so than software that isn't very fast. Even with a sluggish back end, a snappy front end can provide a reasonably good experience for users.

- Features over documentation: implementing features is more important than providing extensive documentation on how to use them. The features should be visible right from the start, and users should be able to learn the features by using them.
