### What are practices that you should continue during next sprint?
- Daily standups
- Creating UI designs before implementation
- Creating API design before backend implementation
- UI should follow the criterias of satisfaction and developers should follow UI as best as they can

### What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint?
- Have a stricter schedule 
    - Finish frontend and backend 3 days before the end of sprint to leave time for integration
- Clean up the code to ensure consistency
- Communicate blockers more frequently and ask for help early on
    - If a team member is available then they can assign themselves to a blocker
    - If there is a blocker for more than 3 days, explore other options

### What are some harmful practices that you might want to stop using during next sprint?
- Late frontend and backend integration
- Not asking for help early enough

### What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?
- Best: Building new features on pre-existing working features
- Best: Demo
- Worst: Last integration
